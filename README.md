# Unit-4-Game

Crystal Collector Game!

HTML/CSS/JS/JQuery based number game app.

Here's how the app works:

* There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.

* The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.

* When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. 

* The game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal.
   
* The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.

* The player loses if their score goes above the random number.

* The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.

* When the game begins again, the player sees a new random number, the user's score and score counter is reset to zero. Also, all the crystals    are assigned new values.
